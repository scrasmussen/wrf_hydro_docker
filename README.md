# Description

This repository contains Dockerfiles and associated container contents for [WRF-Hydro](https://github.com/NCAR/wrf_hydro_nwm_public).
These images are available on the [WRF-Hydro Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/u/wrfhydro/).
Large datasets are sometimes required and are avilable on a public Google Drive folder at
[WRF_HYDRO_DOCKER_DATA](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NY9YdVLcJMIqE6ibLVyKe1fJ-Eoj74Kr).

Each subdirectory in this repository corresponds to a Docker image on the [WRF-Hydro Docker Hub page]
(https://hub.docker.com/u/wrfhydro/).
